# Getting Started with Timer/Counter Type F (TCF)

This repository contains examples of MCC Melody generated source code for the new TCF of the AVR<sup>Â®</sup> EB' family of devices as described in TBxxxx. This example provides two application examples, along with their functionalities.

 * [<strong>Generate Two Constant On-Time PWM Signals in NCO Pulse-Frequency Waveform Generation Mode using the TCF:</strong>](./NCO-Pulse-Length-Demo/readme.md) In this use case, the TCF is configured to generate an overflow event on the compare registers at a fixed frequency while increasing the waveform duty cycle, through all possible lengths.
  * [<strong>Generate Two Variable-Frequency Signals in NCO-Fixed Mode using the TCF:</strong>](./NCO-Fixed-Duty-Cycle/readme.md) In this case, the TCF is configured to generate an overflow event on the compare registers on a range of frequencies (from 10 Hz to 100 KHz).
